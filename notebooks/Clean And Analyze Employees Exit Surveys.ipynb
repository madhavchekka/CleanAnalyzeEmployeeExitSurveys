Even though both the surveys used the same template, the way the questions are answered is different.For example, in the tafe_survey dataset,to say the that Job Dissatisfaction as the contribuiting factor, record has Job Dissatisfaction as the value where as in dete_survey, to say that Job dissatisfaction is a contribuiting factor, record has True or False. It's true for other contribuiting factors as well. For features like skills, opportunities for professional development, one survey has data like Agree, Strongly agree etc., while other survery has A, SA etc. It would be easy to group the data for analysis when some of these features are melted to make the dataset a tidy dataset.\n",
